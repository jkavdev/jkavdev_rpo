very repetitive code, lots of try-finally

checked sqlexceptions everywhere

one must know sql, and know which sql dialect to speak

entity and sql can get out of sync as code evolves

table initialization

multiple table initializations throw exceptions 

marchalling and unmarshalling is very clunsy

no transactions??

joins??

no explicit relationship betweeb entities(one-to-one)

Servlet Pain Points
	httpServlet API is restrictive
	it's hard to remember where different things were implemented
		because they're all if-elses
